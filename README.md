# Driverless Forklift Route Simulation

This project simulates the movement of driverless forklifts operating along pre-defined routes in a warehouse or production facility. Each forklift is restricted to its designated pathwayâ€”ensuring that, for example, a red forklift only travels on routes marked in red. 

## Key Features

- **Real-World Operation Model:**  
  Forklifts follow dedicated paths (e.g., blue forklift on the blue route, red forklift on the red route) to minimize route conflicts and operational complexity.

- **Simulation Dynamics:**  
  - **Kinematic Modeling:**  
    Forklifts accelerate with a basic model (up to a maximum speed of 3 m/s) and experience a 120-second loading/unloading delay at each stop.
  - **Dynamic Route Planning:**  
    Once a forklift completes its current route, it randomly selects a new route from its designated pool. This ensures both a return trip and varied routing while remaining on the assigned pathway.
  - **Visual Representation:**  
    The simulation is visualized using Python, Matplotlib, and NumPy, providing an intuitive overview of the forklift movements over a 3-minute (180-second) timeframe.
